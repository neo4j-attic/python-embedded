=== JPype JVM configuration ===

You can set extra arguments to be passed to the JVM using the +NEO4J_PYTHON_JVMARGS+ environment variable. 
This can be used to, for instance, increase the max memory for the database.

Note that you must set this before you import the neo4j package, either by setting it before you start python, or by setting it programatically in your app.

[source,python]
----
import os
os.environ['NEO4J_PYTHON_JVMARGS'] = '-Xms128M -Xmx512M'
import neo4j
----

You can also override the classpath used by neo4j-embedded, by setting the +NEO4J_PYTHON_CLASSPATH+ environment variable.
